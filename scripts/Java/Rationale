Rationale

There is a proposal to alleviate the cost of inter-frame communication by reducing the cost of SSTORE when it modifies the same item multiple times within the same transaction (EIP-1087).

Relative cons of the transient storage: new code in the clients; new concept for the yellow paper ; requires separation of concerns (persistence and inter-frame communication) when programming.

Relative pros of the transient storage: cheaper to use;
