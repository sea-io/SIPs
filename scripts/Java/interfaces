Specification

Two new opcodes are added to EVM, TLOAD and TSTORE.

They use the same arguments on stack as SLOAD (0x54) and SSTORE (0x55).

TLOAD pops one 32-byte word from the top of the stack, treats this value as the address, fetches 32-byte word from the transient storage at that address, and pops the value on top of the stack.

TSTORE pops two 32-byte words from the top of the stack. The word on the top is the address, and the next is the value. TSTORE saves the value at the given address in the transient storage.

Addressing is the same as SLOAD and SSTORE. i.e. each 32-byte address points to a unique 32-byte word.

Gas cost for both is 8 units of gas, regardless of values stored.

The effects of transient storage are discarded at the end of the transaction.

Transient storage is private to the contract that owns it, in the same way as "regular" storage is. Only owning contract frames may access their transient storage. And when they do, all the frames access the same transient store, in the same way as "regular" storage, but unlike "memory".

When transient storage is used in the context of DELEGATECALL or CALLCODE, then the owning contract of the transient storage is the contract that issued DELEGATECALL or CALLCODE instruction (the caller). When transient storage is used in the context of CALL or STATICCALL, then the owning contract of the transient storage is the contract that is the target of the CALL or STATICCALL instruction (the callee).

Transient storage does not interact with reverts or invalid transactions, that means if a frame reverts, its effects on the transient storage remain until the end of the transaction.
